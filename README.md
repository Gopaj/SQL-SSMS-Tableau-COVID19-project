# SQL-SSMS-Tableau-COVID19-project

*** Work in progress ***

Exploring covid19 data with Sql and doing some cleaning/transformation. Find attached .sql files to see queries. 


Trying tableau for visualization, just to test it out. 
Visualization found using link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thomas.n.rgaard/viz/CovidProject-Visualization/Dashboard1 

Currently the viz is looking at infection rates, will explore other things using same data at a later time. 

Data from excel files, or to be downloaded updated from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
